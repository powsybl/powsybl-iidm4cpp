PowSyBl (<b>Pow</b>er <b>Sy</b>stem <b>Bl</b>ocks) is an open source library written in Java,
dedicated to electrical grid modeling, simulation and visualisation, licensed under the [Mozilla Public License version 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).
It is part of [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/), an open source foundation focused on the energy sector, hosted within The Linux Foundation.

The powsybl-iidm4cpp repository is dedicated to a C++ implementation for IIDM.

This readthedocs is dedicated to documenting the changes made to the repository in order to follow the evolution of IIDM. The changes are currently limited to what is necessary for the [dynawo project](https://github.com/dynawo). That means that IIDM features are not fully supported here. If you need some features to be added, please contact us via [Slack](https://powsybl.slack.com/archives/CGAAPNWTY).
In addition to those pages, please read the [README.md](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-iidm4cpp?tab=readme-ov-file#powsybl---iidm-for-c) to learn more about how to build the project.
